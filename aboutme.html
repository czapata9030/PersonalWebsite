          <div class="textbox" id="text1"><h3 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h3> 
            Hello there! My name is Carlos Zapata III and I’m an aspiring software developer 
            and computer engineer. At Texas A&M, I’ve had the opportunity to take 
            courses focused on programming essentials such as data structures, web development, and
            software development strategies. During these courses, I've worked in various languages and frameworks
            including C++, Java, assembly ARMv8, Angular, and React.js. I’m hoping to apply and grow these skills in 
            future computer engineering positions developing either software or hardware.
            <p></p>

          <div class="textbox" id="text2"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>
              I’ve always had a wide variety of interests. I constantly find myself gravitating to 
              all kinds of artistic, active, and technological hobbies. When I was little, my father 
              would come home, crack open computers from work, and call me over to show me the parts
              on the inside. It’s been a long time since then, but I believe my dad inspired me to
              take up a career exploring not just computer hardware, but software as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I got older, I started creating abstract drawings and landscape paintings. Making art
              made me realize how important design is to all aspects of life. In engineering and 
              software design, form factor can be just as important to the product as its functionality.
              I often find myself now using an art-framed mindset to nail detail-oriented work.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a college student, I find having an outlet for stress to be more important than ever.
              When classes, labs, applications, and personal life get overwhelming,
              I find myself either swimming laps with the TAMU club team or playing volleyball at the
              REC center. These hobbies give me a great way to decompress and partake in some friendly
              competition with my fellow Aggies. 
            
            </p>

          <div class="bigimg bigimg-3">
            <button class="button-Q" onclick="location.href='service.html'"><span>Service</span></button>
          </div>
          <div class="textbox" id="text3" style="padding-bottom: 200px"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Service</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout my time in high school, I would often find myself volunteering for my swim team, school, 
              and other organizations around my home town. Being able to give back to my community has always been important
              to me. When I was younger, I would volunteer at my brother’s middle school and help run the concession stand during 
              football, volleyball, and basketball games.
              After I joined the National Honor Society, I took it a step further and made my personal
              service project a clean-up of the Barton Bobcat football field. Now I mainly volunteer with organizations
              such as TAMU Swim Club and participate in large service events such as The Big Event.
